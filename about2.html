      <center><h2> C programming</h2></center>
   
      <p>C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. C programming is an excellent language to learn to program for beginners. It was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell lab. It is procedural language which means that people can write their program as a series of step by step instructions.</p> <br>

     <h4>  Professor : Dr. Anirban Choudhary</h4> <br>
         <p>C is the mother of all language and the biggest reason to learn because it is easier to understand and compile the code. c is the core of every language. with C can write fewer lines of code,complete the job much quicker.</p>

      <center><h2>Operating system</h2></center>
   
      <p>An operating system is the interface between the user and the computer hardware.it is a system software that manages computer hardware,software resource and provide common service for computer programs. for hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation. it acts as a intermediate between programs and the commputer hardware although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an operating function.</p>
      <h4> Professor : Dr Vishnu Priya </h4> <br>
   <p> Learning Operating system can change the perception of a coder to a large extent. A good operating system concept will increase my value as a coder.</p>

      <center><h2> Data structure</h2></center>
   
      <p> A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. </p>
      <h4> Professor : Dr Amit Bhagat</h4>

   <p>Data Structures (DS) tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Data Structure. Our Data Structure tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.Data Structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently.</p>

   <center> <h2>Computer architecture and organisation </h2></center>

   <p> computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems. Architecture is decribed as the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation.It involves instruction set architecture design, microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation.</p>
   <h4> Professor:Dr Anoop Tiwari</h4>
   <p>This subject explores how machines are designed, built, and operate. Knowing what's inside and how it works will help me design, develop, and implement applications better, faster, cheaper, more efficient, and easier to use because i will be able to make informed decisions instead of guestimating and assuming.</p>

<center> <h2> Business communication </h2></center>

<p>Business communication encompasses topics such as marketing, brand management, customer relations, consumer behavior, advertising, public relations, corporate communication, community engagement, reputation management, interpersonal communication, employee engagement, and event management. It is closely related to the fields of professional communication and technical communication.</p>
<h4>Professor: Dr Anjuli jain</h4>
<p>this is one of the most important subject as we learn how to communicate in professional world.A well-rounded business communication course can help oneself understand the power of visual communication, interpret business visuals, and make intelligent design choices in their own documents and presentations.</p>

   <center><h2> Discrete Mathematics </h2></center>

   <p> Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. In contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying "smoothly", the objects studied in discrete mathematics – such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic – do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values. Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as calculus or Euclidean geometry</p>
   <h4>Professor : Dr Manoj jha and Dr Madhvi Shakya</h4>
   <p>The mathematics of modern computer science is built almost entirely on discrete math, in particular combinatorics and graph theory. This means that in order to learn the fundamental algorithms used by computer programmers, i need a solid background in this subjects.</p>
